# Smart_Home
# Description of the project
 It is a Python-based IoT simulator for a smart
home automation system. The simulator emulates the behavior of various IoT
devices commonly found in a smart home, such as smart lights, thermostats, and
security cameras. I created central automation system that manages these
devices and build a monitoring dashboard to visualize and control the smart home.
This project helped me to master Python programming skills, including OOP,
data handling, real-time data monitoring, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
